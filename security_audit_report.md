# Security and Privacy Audit Report for MaBoutique.ma

## 1. Firebase Permissions

- **Firestore Rules:**  
  - Ensure Firestore rules restrict read/write access only to authenticated users.  
  - Use role-based access control to limit data access to owners (e.g., professionals can only edit their own profiles).  
  - Validate data on write to prevent injection or malformed data.

- **FCM Tokens:**  
  - Store FCM tokens securely and associate them with authenticated users only.  
  - Implement token rotation and cleanup for inactive devices.

## 2. JWT Expiration and Refresh Token Logic

- **Expiration:**  
  - Set reasonable expiration times for access tokens (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour).  
  - Use refresh tokens with longer expiration to obtain new access tokens.

- **Refresh Tokens:**  
  - Store refresh tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or secure storage).  
  - Implement endpoint to refresh tokens with proper validation.  
  - Revoke refresh tokens on logout or suspicious activity.

## 3. User Data Handling

- **Profile Updates:**  
  - Validate all input data server-side.  
  - Log changes for audit purposes.  
  - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

- **Data Deletion:**  
  - Provide users with the ability to delete their accounts and associated data.  
  - Implement soft delete or anonymization where appropriate.

## 4. GDPR-Friendly Features

- **Data Export:**  
  - Allow users to export their personal data in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON).  
  - Provide clear instructions and UI for data export requests.

- **Opt-In/Opt-Out:**  
  - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.  
  - Allow users to opt-out of marketing communications and data sharing.  
  - Maintain records of consent.

## Recommendations

- Regularly review and update Firebase security rules.  
- Use secure storage and transmission for all sensitive data.  
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events.  
- Educate users about privacy policies and data usage transparently.
